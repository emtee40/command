All development is done with ccbuild, so entering the source directory and executing ccbuild, should produce a valid binary.

If you have ccbuild, you can also run "sh bootstrap", this will generate CMakeLists.txt from a template.

Some code documentation can be generated using doxygen.

Most Debian based systems should be able to see a valid build procedure in Travis-CI.
